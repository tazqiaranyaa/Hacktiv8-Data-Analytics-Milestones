# Milestone 2 – Hacktiv8 Comprehensive Data Analytics Program (Phase 1)

This milestone is part of my Phase 1 learning journey in the Hacktiv8 Comprehensive Data Analytics Program. The goal was to showcase my ability to tackle a real-world data problem by performing analysis and creating visualizations to support decision-making.

This program was created to analyze the effectiveness of digital marketing campaigns based on customer data, marketing channels, and ad performance, in order to provide insights for improving marketing strategies and conversion rates.

**Source data:** [Kaggle – Predict Conversion in Digital Marketing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predict-conversion-in-digital-marketing-dataset?utm)

## Assignment Overview

As a Data Analyst, I was tasked to work on a client project to analyze a dataset and generate insights that could help the client make informed decisions. The assignment required me to combine **statistical analysis** and **dashboard visualization** to address a specific business problem.

## Steps and Milestones

| Step | Description | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | **Problem Identification**: Chose a topic and formulated a **SMART problem statement**. Broke down the problem using structured approaches like 5W+1H. | Problem statement & detailed questions |
| 2 | **Data Sourcing**: Selected a dataset from external sources (BigQuery, Kaggle, BPS, etc.) and ensured proper format (CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL). | Dataset link and source reference |
| 3 | **Dataset Consultation**: Discussed dataset suitability with my buddy, including URL, background, objectives, and target users. | Approval for dataset usage |
| 4 | **Problem Breakdown**: Identified metrics and data fields for analysis. Ensured at least 4 visualization sub-problems, 1 descriptive, and 1 inferential statistic sub-problem. | List of sub-problems and metrics |
| 5 | **Data Extraction & Preparation**: Extracted data using SQL queries and cleaned it in Python (Jupyter Notebook). Renamed columns, handled missing values, and preprocessed dataset. | Cleaned dataset and SQL queries |
| 6 | **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Created visualizations (bar, line, etc.) for each sub-problem. Conducted descriptive stats (central tendency, variance, distribution) and inferential stats (hypothesis testing). | Jupyter Notebook with analysis and visualizations |
| 7 | **Dashboard Creation**: Built Tableau Public dashboard combining visualizations and statistical analysis. Includes at least 4 figures and interactive components. | Tableau Public dashboard URL |
| 8 | **Reporting & Submission**: Linked dashboard in notebook and README, saved notebook as `P1M2_<my-name>.ipynb`, pushed to GitHub Classroom. | Submitted notebook and GitHub link |
